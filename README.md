Visit the live demo: [https://yourusername.github.io/strava-bike-tracker/](https://yourusername.github.io/strava-bike-tracker/)

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. A Strava account with bike data
2. A Strava API application (free to create)
3. A GitHub account for hosting

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Fork/Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/strava-bike-tracker.git
cd strava-bike-tracker
```

### 2. Create a Strava API Application

1. Go to [Strava API Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
2. Click "Create App"
3. Fill in the application details:
   - **Application Name**: "Bike Tracker" (or your preferred name)
   - **Category**: "Other"
   - **Club**: Leave blank
   - **Website**: `https://yourusername.github.io/strava-bike-tracker/`
   - **Authorization Callback Domain**: `yourusername.github.io`
   - **Description**: "Track bike mileage from Strava data"

4. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 3. Configure the Application

1. Open `config.js` in your text editor
2. Replace `YOUR_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Client ID from step 2
3. The `REDIRECT_URI` will automatically be set to your GitHub Pages URL

```javascript
CLIENT_ID: '12345', // Replace with your actual Client ID
```

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push your changes to your GitHub repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup with Strava API configuration"
git push origin main
```

2. Go to your repository on GitHub
3. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select the "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

Your app will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/strava-bike-tracker/` in a few minutes.

## üîß Important Security Note

This application currently includes placeholder text for the Client Secret. For a production deployment, you should:

1. **Never expose your Client Secret in client-side code**
2. Set up a backend service (like Vercel, Netlify Functions, or AWS Lambda) to handle the OAuth token exchange
3. Update the token exchange endpoints to use your backend service

For development and personal use, you can temporarily add your Client Secret directly to the code, but **never commit it to a public repository**.

## üì± How to Use

1. **Connect Strava**: Click "Connect Strava Account" and authorize the application
2. **Select Dates**: Choose your start and end dates for the analysis
3. **Get Data**: Click "Get Bike Data" to fetch your riding statistics
4. **View Results**: See distance, rides, and elevation for each bike
5. **Change Account**: Use "Change Account" to switch Strava accounts if needed
